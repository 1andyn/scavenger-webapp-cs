# scavenger-webapp-cs
Simple Virtual Scavenger Hunt implemented as a React Single page Application protecting each step with a password.
This is the client sided only version which will not have a protected backend to prevent source code peeking from seeing passwords. The purpose of this is to be able to host this on a free platform such as github or gitlab as a page repo branch.

**Planned functionality:**
 - Display an Introduction
 - Shows initial scavenger hunt step (image and clues and a password prompt)
 - Entering the correct password will transition into the next step

# dependencies
 - react for front end
	 - react-spring (for animations to look nicer)
	 - bootstrap (UI)
